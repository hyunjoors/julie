<!-- ## Why did you decide to look at Cost of Living around the world? (Can be very personal)-->
For as long as I can remember, I have always enjoyed traveling. It has become a part of me, and my plans for after finishing my undergrad studies is to travel. Recently, however, I became more interested in the idea of moving to a specific area for a period of time and experience their life and culture. As a result, I decided to look into the cost of living around the world, which could potentially help me decide on where to settle.

I searched for information about how much it would cost for me to live in a certain country.And I found the most recent Cost of Living data <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankanhore545/cost-of-living-index-2022/data">Cost of Living data</a>.

But this data and other resources that I found were mostly provided in a table or graph form. Like the table below.

This format is a bit less convenient for me because I'm a visual person. So I decided to visualize it for my own convenience.

With this interactive map, I was able to quickly locate which country I might want to live in in terms of cost of living.

While looking at this map, I was surprised with the cost of living in my wish-country-to-live-in was very expensive than where I'm currently located.

Being young and immature, and living off of my parents money, everything was practically given to me. However, with this data, I now start to acknowledge the small factors that add up to oneâ€™s living expenses such as health care and insurance. In addition, it gave me a broader aspect of the income inequality in certain parts of the world as there was a wide gap between the spendings of the rich and the poor countries. 


## Final comment

I hope this information is helpful to visitors, who are in my age and plan to move to another country. Before they move, this data could provide a quick look of how much they would need to spend more or less compare to where they are currently living in; also give them suggestions on where to live based on their current status and likings.
