# Introduce Yourself
_provide basic information about yourself and purpose of this webpage_

## Why did you decide to look at Cost of Living around the world? (Can be very personal)

> For as long as I can remember, I have always enjoyed traveling. It has become a part of me, and my plans for after finishing my studies was to travel. Recently, however, I became more interested in the idea of moving to a specific area for a period of time. As a result, I decided to look into the cost of living around the world, which could potentially help me decide on where to settle. 


## What was your main question when doing the project?
> The focus of my project was to find what country was best suitable in cost. As a result the question I kept asking myself when doing this was “What is the best choice in country to live in based on my current status?”

## What techniques did you use to answer your question?

> Mostly, the techniques I used to answer the question was organizing data. I gathered information from other sources and sorted them by countries or what the money is spent on. By doing so, the answer to what country is best for me can be answered easily. 

## What did you learn from the data?

> From the data, I learned about living expenses. Being young and immature, and living off of my parents money, everything was practically given to me. However, with this data, I now start to acknowledge the small factors that add up to one’s living expenses such as health care and insurance. In addition, it gave me a broader aspect of the income inequality in certain parts of the world as there was a wide gap between the spendings of the rich and the poor countries. 

## What outcome do you wish the visitors to take?

> I hope this information is helpful to visitors who plan to move to another country. Before they move, this data will not only basically lay out their entire spendings, but also give them suggestions on where to live based on their current status and likings.
